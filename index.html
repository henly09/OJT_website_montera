      <p class="fst-italic">During my internship, I started a journal to document my experiences and reflect 
        on my growth throughout the program. Writing in my journal each day allowed me to process my 
        thoughts and emotions, and it also helped me to identify areas where I could improve. 
        <br/><br/>I found that the act of writing down my thoughts and observations was very therapeutic 
        and allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of myself and the work I was doing. 
        <br/><br/>Additionally, my journal served as a helpful tool for tracking my progress and 
        accomplishments over time, which was especially valuable during performance evaluations and 
        when setting goals for the future. <br/><br/>Overall, keeping a journal during my internship was an 
        incredibly valuable practice that I plan to continue in my personal and professional life.</p>

    the necessary software environment on our own devices to accomplish future tasks that will be assigned to us. As part of our responsibilities, 
    we explored the source code of the system that was tasked to us and created material components examples or tests on the forked source code 
    of the system. <br/><br/>We were still in the process of learning how to use the VueJS framework, which is used by the company to create websites for 
    clients. One of our tasks involved editing the search bar and date range bar of the system's dashboard, and we also created hovers for the 
    bars that we edited. <br/><br/>Additionally, we made some minor adjustments to the tab bars and background image of the dashboard page. Overall, 
    our experience at Infosoft allowed us to gain valuable skills in web development and work as part of a team on real-world projects. </p>

    <p class="fst-italic">In this week at Infosoft, we were assigned various tasks that allowed us to gain valuable skills in web 
      development. One of our tasks involved adding a "See more..." feature to the system. <br/><br/>However, we encountered a problem where it 
      affected other indexes when clicked, so we had to fix it. <br/><br/>Another task we completed was editing the 250-character limit on the 
      message of the dashboard system. <br/><br/>Additionally, we worked on editing the tab event reset, which resets the index to null when you 
      change the tab page. In addition to these tasks, we also helped with the advertisement for "Camiguin Island Tourism" on the Facebook 
      social media platform. <br/><br/>Finally, we adjusted the advance search list of the system, specifically focusing on the clear button and 
      making it as responsive as possible. <br/><br/>Overall, these tasks allowed us to gain practical experience in web development and learn to 
      work as part of a team on real-world projects.</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">In this week at Infosoft, we were tasked with various assignments that allowed us to gain valuable skills 
      in web development and social media marketing. One of our tasks was to make the "Search Bar" responsive of the system, which required 
      us to ensure that it worked smoothly across different devices. <br/><br/>Another task we completed was redesigning the "Session Poll" page of 
      the system by adding some colors and features to improve its functionality. Additionally, we spent some time doing spreadsheet work 
      for the social media marketing of the company. <br/><br/>Specifically, we worked on validating users who visited Camiguin to see if they interacted 
      with the company's ads or not. As part of this task, we also worked on the launch of the advertisement for the Camiguin Island Tourism. 
      <br/><br/>Another task we completed was installing a new package on the system called "Vue-MCE," which is used to open PDF, DOCX, and other 
      digital documents on the system. <br/><br/>Overall, our experience at Infosoft allowed us to gain practical experience in web development and 
      social media marketing and work as part of a team on real-world projects.</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">In this week, i was assigned as an intern on the social media marketing team at this company, 
      <br/><br/>I have been tasked with working on spreadsheets, which is a significant responsibility. Today was no different 
      as I spent my day doing spreadsheet work for the team. 
      <br/><br/>It is not the most glamorous job, but it is essential in ensuring that our social media campaigns run smoothly.
      During the day, I was assigned a new set of data that I needed to sort and verify. This new data would eventually 
      be added to the team's spreadsheets, so it was vital that I ensured its accuracy and completeness. It was a challenging 
      task, but I enjoyed it as it allowed me to learn new spreadsheet techniques and improve my attention to detail.
      <br/><br/>Being an intern on the social media marketing team has been a great learning experience so far. I have had the 
      opportunity to work with professionals who have taught me valuable skills and insights into the world of social 
      media marketing. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this team, and I am eager to continue learning and growing my skills.
      <br/><br/>Overall, today was a productive day, and I feel like I am making a valuable contribution to the team's efforts. 
      I look forward to what the future holds and the opportunities to take on more challenging tasks.</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">In this week marks my first day on a new project that has been assigned to our team. Our task is to develop an e-filing system for the Department of Health (DOH), which is an exciting and challenging opportunity for me as an intern.
      <br/><br/>As soon as I arrived at the office, I was immediately assigned to analyze and study the source code that had been provided to us. It was a daunting task, but with the guidance of my supervisors, I managed to familiarize myself with the codebase and understand the functionalities that needed to be implemented.   
      <br/><br/>After studying the source code, my team was assigned specific scopes that we needed to create. It was essential that we thoroughly understood the requirements and specifications to ensure that the product we create meets the expectations of our client. We had to constantly communicate with our supervisors to check our progress and ensure that we were on the right track.
      <br/><br/>As an intern at Infosoft, I am grateful for this opportunity to work on a project that has a significant impact on the healthcare industry. I am confident that with the guidance of our supervisors and the skills and knowledge I have acquired, we will successfully complete this project and deliver a high-quality e-filing system for DOH.
      <br/><br/>Overall, today was a challenging yet exciting day, and I am looking forward to the rest of my internship and the opportunities to learn and grow.</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">Another challenging week for me as an intern on the DOH project. I am currently working on the header sorter, and my mentor has instructed me to apply sortation on the v-data-table. It was a complex task, but with the help of my colleagues, I was able to implement the changes and improve the project's functionality.
      <br/><br/>In addition to the header sorter, I was assigned to make another navigation tab and revise the dialogs to page. It was a tedious task, but it was necessary to ensure that the user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate. I also created the PPMP page and created Roles page and User Roles page for the assignation of the user's roles for the filtering of navigation.
      <br/><br/>However, while working on the assignation of roles on the User Roles page, I encountered a problem where multi-role on users was having conflicts on the filtering of navigations. I consulted with my mentor and colleagues, and we came up with a solution that involved revising the filtering of navigation that depends on the user's roles on the system. It was a challenging problem, but it was a great learning experience.
      <br/><br/>As an intern at Infosoft, I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and to be part of a team that values collaboration and innovation. I am constantly learning new skills and techniques, and I am excited to see how my contribution will help shape the project's success.
      <br/><br/>Overall, today was another productive day, and I am looking forward to the rest of my internship at Infosoft. I know that there will be more challenges ahead, but I am confident that with the support of my colleagues and mentors, I can overcome them and continue to grow as a professional.</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">As an intern at Infosoft, I have been assigned to work on various tasks related to the DOH project. Recently, I have been focusing on revising and debugging the PPMP and userRevision sections. This involves adding new components, such as the v-autocomplete, and implementing lazy loading features. 
      <br/><br/>Additionally, I have been working on the sub-category section of the project, creating buttons for viewing and editing the data.
      Another task I have been working on is adding an Edit Page for the PPMP and implementing procurement CRUD for the system. 
      <br/><br/>I have also made revisions to the headers and sorting buttons on the pages. One of the challenges I encountered was converting integers to money digits in the v-text-field of budgets on the PPMP pages. To solve this, I used regex to convert characters in the strings of numbers. 
      <br/><br/>Aside from these tasks, I have also been working on error handling and creating new pages for the system, such as the Officers page and the UserPositions page. These pages involve assigning positions to users on the system and implementing CRUD functions. Overall, I have been learning a lot and gaining valuable experience in software development during my internship at Infosoft.</p>

      <h2>Internship System Project</h2>
      <p class="fst-italic">An intern's system or presentation after the internship in a company 
        serves various purposes. It enables interns to demonstrate the skills and knowledge they 
        have gained during their time with the company, helping them to showcase their value and 
        potential as a future employee. Additionally, it provides interns with a chance to reflect 
        on their experiences and receive feedback that can help them improve their skills. Presenting 
        a system or presentation can also be a valuable experience for interns in developing their 
        communication and presentation skills. &nbsp
        Moreover, the system or presentation can also be useful for the company. It provides insights 
        into the intern's work and contributions during their time with the company, helping the 
        company to evaluate the effectiveness of its internship program and make necessary improvements 
        for future interns. Overall, presenting a system or presentation is an essential component 
        of the internship experience that offers mutual benefits for the intern and the company.</p>

      <h2>Internship Certification of Completion</h2>
      <p class="fst-italic">The purpose of a certificate of completion for an internship is to provide formal recognition to the 
        intern for successfully completing their internship program. It serves as a credential that verifies the 
        intern's participation in the program and the skills and knowledge they have acquired during their time with the company.
        The certificate of completion also demonstrates the company's commitment to providing meaningful learning opportunities 
        to interns and its support of their professional development. It can be a valuable addition to the intern's resume, helping 
        them to stand out to potential employers and showcase their practical experience.
        Moreover, the certificate of completion can serve as evidence of the intern's achievements, which can be 
        helpful when applying for further education or training programs. It can also be a useful reference for the 
        intern's professional network, demonstrating their skills and competence in a particular field.
